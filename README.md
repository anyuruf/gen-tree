#Genealogy tree

A genealogy tree is a tool to visualize genetic and/or relational connections between individuals. 

Build a UI with the binary tree diagram of Daxcsa. Because the complete tree can contain "n" levels of depth, it's not a good practice to display all the levels, so you should figure out how many levels to show and how to visually navigate between all of them. Additionally, for every node, you should find a way to show the detailed info of each person like username, full name, email, status, product, and category, this information is included in the JSON file. 

Considerations:
-The tree should be mobile friendly
-The tree performance is important
-The tree must support a way to navigate between the parents and children of every node
-The binary placement of each node (left or right) is important

Hints:
-To navigate between the children or parents of a selected node you can replace the root with the new node or in another case, extend the tree to show the children
-In mobile devices you can hide some levels
-Find attached 3 different examples of trees


You have to publish a screenshot of the graphical binary tree and the source code of your project on any of these platforms GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket, and send us the link.
